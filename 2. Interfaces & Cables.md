# Ethernet Standards (Copper Cables)
| Speed    | Common Name      | IEEE Standard | Informal Name | Maximum Length | # of Wires Used   |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| 10 Mbps  | Ethernet         | 802.3i        | 10BATE-T      | 100 m          | 2 pairs (4 wires) |
| 100 Mbps | Fast Ethernet    | 802.3u        | 100BASE-T     | 100 m          | 2 pairs (4 wires) |
| 1 Gbps   | Gigabit Ethernet | 802.3ab       | 1000BASE-T    | 100 m          | 4 pairs (8 wires) |
| 10 Gbps  | 10 Gig Ethernet  | 802.3an       | 10GBASE-T     | 100 m          | 4 pairs (8 wires) |
# UTP Cables
- UTP = Unshielded Twisted Pair
- 8 wires in total
### 10BASE-T & 100BASE-T
- Pins 1 & 2 of the computer transmit data (Tx)
- Pins 1 & 2 of the switch receive data (Rx)
- Pins 3 & 6 of the computer receive data (Rx)
- Pins 3 & 6 of the switch transmit data (Tx)
- Full-Duplex is supported by this because both the computer and switch can be transmitting and receiving at the same time
- This uses a straight-through cable

<small>This same set of pins is applicable in router-to-switch connections too</small>

- When connecting devices with the same pin configuration (i.e. switch-to-switch, router-to-router, PC-to-PC, PC-to-router, etc.) use a crossover cable
- When using a crossover cable, pin 1 connects to pin 3 and pin 2 connects to pin 6

| Device Type | Transmit (Tx) Pins | Receive (Rx) Pins |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Router      | 1 and 2            | 3 and 6           |
| Firewall    | 1 and 2            | 3 and 6           |
| PC          | 1 and 2            | 3 and 6           |
| Switch      | 3 and 6            | 1 and 2           |
### Auto MDI-X
- Feature that detects if pins are improperly configured (ex. transmit pins are connected to transmit pins) and automatically changes the pins it uses for transmitting and receiving to facilitate proper communication
### 1000BASE-T & 10GBASE-T
- The pairs are 1 & 2, 3 & 6, 4 & 5, and 7 & 8
- Each pair is bidirectional, meaning they're not necessarily dedicated to just transmitting or receiving
	- This is why 1000BASE-T & 10GBASE-T can transmit at much faster speeds
# Fiber-Optic Connections
- A fiber-optic cable consists of two cables, one for transmitting at A & receiving at B and vice versa for the other

![[Fiber-Optic Cable Diagram.png]]

- Two kinds of fiber-optic cables:
	1. Multimode Fiber
		- Wider core diameter than single-mode fiber
		- Allows multiple angles (modes) of light waves to enter the fiberglass core
		- Allows longer cables than UTP, but shorter cables than single-mode fiber
		- Cheaper than single-mode fiber
	
	![[Multimode Fiber.png]]
	1. Single-Mode Fiber
		- Core diameter is narrower than mutlimode fiber
		- Light enters at a single angle (mode) from a laser-based transmitter
		- Allows longer cables than both UTP and multimode fiber
		- More expensive than multimode fiber

# UTP vs Fiber-Optic Cabling
### UTP
- Lower cost than fiber-optic
- Shorter maximum distance than fiber-optic (~100m)
- Can be vulnerable to EMI
- RJ45 ports used with UTP are cheaper than SFP ports
- Emit (leak) a faint signal outside of the cable which can be copied (security risk)
### Fiber-Optic
- Higher cost than UTP
- Longer maximum distance than UTP
- No vulnerability to EMI
- SFP ports are more expensive than RJ45 ports (single-mode is more expensive than multimode)
- Does not emit any signal outside of the cable (no security risk)

### Hierarchy of Cost: Single-Mode Fiber > Multimode Fiber > UTP
### Hierarchy of Distance: Single-Mode Fiber > Multimode Fiber > UTP
