- DNS A records = IPv4; DNS AAAA records = IPv6
- TCP/UDP 53
	- TCP used for DNS messages > 512 bytes
## Configuring DNS
- A Cisco router can be both a DNS server and a DNS client at the same time
	- Configure a router to be a DNS server with `(config)# ip dns server`
	- Add DNS entries to the router with `(config)# ip host <hostname> <ip address>`
	- Configure a DNS server the router will query if the requested record isn't found in the host table with `(config)# ip name-server <ip address>`
	- Enable the router to perform DNS queries with `(config)# ip domain lookup` (typically enabled by default)
	- Optionally, configure the default domain name with `(config)# ip domain name <url>`
		- What this does is append the given domain name to any hostnames without a specified domain. For example, the command `ping pc1` would become `ping pc1.jeremysitlab.com`
			- This is similar in functionality to an Active Directory domain
	- Displays the cached name/IP address mappings learned via DNS with `# show hosts`
