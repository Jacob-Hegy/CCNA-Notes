# Ethernet Header

![[Ethernet Header Dissection.png]]

- Minimum size for an Ethernet frame (Header + Payload \[Packet] + Trailer) = 64 bytes
	- Within that, the header and trailer total to 18 bytes (not counting the preamble and SFD because those potentially might not be included), thus **the payload must be at least 46 bytes**
- If the payload/packet is less than 46 bytes in length, padding bytes are added to reach 46 bytes
	- Ex. Header (Destination + Source + Type = 14 bytes) + Payload (34 bytes) + Trailer (FCS = 4 bytes) = 52 bytes; thus add 12 bytes of padding to the end of the payload
### Preamble
- 7 bytes
- Alternating 1s and 0s (10101010 * 7)
- Allows devices to sync their receiver clocks
### SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)
- 1 byte
- 10101011
- Marks the end of the preamble and the beginning of the rest of the frame
### Destination & Source
- 6 bytes each
- MAC address of their respective end point
### Type/Length
- 2 bytes
- If value is <= 1500, this field indicates the length of the encapsulated packet in bytes
- If value is >= 1536, this field indicates the type of the encapsulated packet
	- IPv4 = 0x0800
	- IPv4 = 0x86DD
	- ARP = 0x0806
### FCS (Frame Check Sequence)
- 4 bytes
- Detects corrupted data by running a CRC algorithm over the received data
	- CRC = Cyclic Redundancy Check
# MAC Address
- First half of MAC address (24 bits) = OUI (Organization Unique Identifier)
	- The unique value assigned to the maker of the device
- By default, dynamically learning MAC addresses are aged-out after 5 minutes of inactivity
	- View MAC address table on switch with `S# show mac address-table`
- Clear dynamic MAC addresses in the MAC address table with `S# clear mac address-table dynamic`
- Clear a specific MAC address in the MAC address table with `S# clear mac address-table dynamic address <MAC address>`
- Clear all MAC addresses in the MAC address table for a specific interface with `S# clear mac address-table dynamic interface <int>`
- Send an ICMP ping of a certain size with `R# ping <IP address> size <integer>`
- View the ARP table with `R# show arp`
- Configure a description on a switch interface with `(config-if)# description <description>`
