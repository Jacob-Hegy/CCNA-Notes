# DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)
- Allows switches to dynamically configure their interfaces to access or trunk
	- Two switches together can form a trunk, otherwise the interface is automatically access
- Enabled by default on all Cisco switch interfaces
- FOR SECURITY PURPOSES disable DTP and use manual configuration to avoid exploitation
	- Disabled with `(config-if)# switchport nonegotiate`
- For clarity: Access port = only 1 VLAN allowed, Trunk port = multiple VLANs allowed
#### Switchport Behavior
| Switchport Mode   | Behavior                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access            | Allows 1 VLAN                                                                                                 |
| Trunk             | Allows multiple VLANs                                                                                         |
| Dynamic Auto      | Forms a trunk with interfaces in Trunk or Dynamic Desirable mode (else remains an access port)                |
| Dynamic Desirable | Forms a trunk with interfaces in Trunk, Dynamic Desirable, or Dynamic Auto mode (else remains an access port) |
## Behavior Notes
- If an interface manually configured to trunk mode is connected to an interface manually configured to access mode, the two are forced to operate mismatched (results in an error)
- DTP will only configure itself with other switches, not routers, PCs, etc.
	- The switchport will be in access mode for other devices
- Desirable is default on older switches, Auto is default on newer switches
- Configuring with `(config-if)# switchport mode access` also disables DTP on an interface
- DTP also enables the negotiation of 802.1Q and ISL encapsulations
	- ISL is favored over ISL
	- DTP frames are sent in VLAN1 for ISL and the native VLAN for 802.1Q
	- Negotiation is default for trunk ports (switchport trunk encapsulation negotiate)
## Configuration
- Set an interface to Dynamic Auto mode with `(config-if)# switchport mode dynamic auto`
- Set an interface to Dynamic Desirable mode with`(config-if)# switchport mode dynamic desirable`
- View information on an interface with `(config)# show int <x> switchport`
# VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)
- Allows the configuration of VLANs on a central VTP server switches
	- Switches in the network (VTP client) will sync their VTP database with the server
	- Good for large networks with many VLANs
- Rarely used and not recommended
- VTPv1 and VTPv2 don't support VLANs 1006-4094
## Modes
### Server
- Can add, modify, and delete VLANs
- Default for Cisco switches
- Stores VLAN database in non-volatile RAM (NVRAM)
	- Increment revision number with every change (used to sync up databases)
		- Will advertise the latest version of VLAN database on trunk ports
- Also functions as a client
### Client
- Cannot add, modify, or delete VLANs
- Doesn't store the VLAN db in NVRAM (unless in VTPv3)
- Syncs their VLAN db to the server with the highest revision number in their VTP domain (if the switch is not part of a domain, it will automatically join the domain of the first VTP advertisement it receives)
	- Advertises their VLAN db and forward VTP advertisements to other clients over their trunk ports
### Transparent
- Don't participate in the VTP domain or sync their VLAN database
	- Maintains its own independent VLAN db in NVRAM
	- Forwards VTP advertisements that are in the same domain as it
## Configuration
- Set the VTP mode for a switch with `(config)# vtp mode {server | client | transparent}`
- Change the VTP version used on the switch with `(config)# vtp version <x>`
	- This increments the revision number, sending out advertisements with this new revision number
- Set VTP revision number to 0 by either...
	- Changing the VTP domain to an unused domain name, or...
	- Change the switch to VTP transparent mode
