DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)
	Allows swtiches to dynamically configure their interfaces to access or trunk
		Two switches together can form a trunk, otherwise the interface is automatically access
	Enabled by default on all Cisco switch interfaces
	FOR SECURITY PURPOSES disable DTP and use manual configuration to avoid exploitation
		Disabled with switchport nonegotiate
	For clarity: access port = only 1 VLAN allowed, trunk port = multiple VLANs allowed
	In conf t
		switchport mode dynamic auto
		switchport mode dynamic desirable - attempts to form a trunk with other switches if other switch is in one of the following modes:
			switchport mode trunk
			switchport mode dynamic desirable
			switchport mode dynamic auto
			otherwise, it remains an access port
		switchport mode dynamic auto - doesn't actively try to form a trunk with other switches, but will form one if the other switch is in one of the following modes:
			switchport mode trunk
			switchport mode dynamic desirable
			otherwise, it remains an access port
		show int x switchport
			Shows information on the interface, including its name if its a switchport, its admin mode, and its operational mode
		If an interface manually configured to trunk mode is connected to an interface manually configured to access mode, the two are forced to operate mismatched (results in an error)
	DTP will only configure itself with other switches, not routers, PCs, etc.
		The switchport will be in access mode for other devices
	desirable is default on older switches, auto is default on newer switches
	Configuring with switchport mode access also disables DTP on an interface
	DTP also enables the negotiation of 802.1Q and ISL encapsulations
		ISL is favored over ISL
		DTP frames are sent in VLAN1 for ISL and the native VLAN for 802.1Q
		Negotiation is default for trunk ports (switchport trunk encapsulation negotiate)

VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)
	Allows the configuration of VLANs on a central VTP server switches
		Switches in the network (VTP client) will sync their VTP database with the server
	Good for large networks with many VLANs
	Rarely used and not recommended
	VTPv1 and VTPv2 don't support VLANs 1006-4094
	Set mode using vtp mode _
	Three modes
		Server
			Can add, modify, and delete VLANs
			Default for Cisco switches
			Store VLAN database in non-volatile RAM (NVRAM)
			Increment revision number with every change (used to sync up databases)
				Will advertise the latest version of VLAN database on trunk ports
			Also functions as a client
		Client
			Cannot add, modify, or delete VLANs
			Don't store the VLAN db in NVRAM (unless in VTPv3)
			Sync their VLAN db to the server with the highest revision number in their VTP domain (if the switch is not part of a domain, it will automatically join the domain of the first VTP advertisement it receives)
			Advertise their VLAN db and forward VTP advertisements to other clients over their trunk ports
		Transparent
			Don't participate in the VTP domain or sync their VLAN database
			Maintains its own independent VLAN db in NVRAM
			Forwards VTP advertisements that are in the same domain as it
	Change used VTP version with vtp version x
		This increments the revision number, sending out advertisements with this new revision number
	Set VTP revision number to 0 by either...
		Changing the VTP domain to an unused domain name, or...
		Change the switch to VTP transparent mode
