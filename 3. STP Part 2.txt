STP States/Timers
	Port states
		Blocking & Forwarding = Stable
		Listening & Learning = Transitional
			Occurs when an interface is activated or when a blocking port transitions to a forwarding state
		Blocking = Non-designated
			Don't send/receive regular network traffic
			Receive STP BPDUs
			Don't forward STP BPDUs
			Don't learn MAC addresses
		Listening = root/designated port going from the blocking state to the listening state
			Only designated or root ports can enter the listening state
			15 seconds long by default (forward delay timer)
			Only forwards/receives STP BPDUs
			Doesn't send/receive regular traffic
			Doesn't learn MAC addresses from regular traffic
		Learning = follows the listening state
			15 seconds long by default (forward delay timer)
			Only sends/receives STP BPDUs
			Doesn't send/receive regular traffic
			DOES learn MAC addresses from regular traffic
		Forwarding = operates as normal
			Sends/receives STP BPDUs
			Sends/receives normal traffic
			Learns MAC addresses
	Timers
		Hello Timer - How often the root bridge sends hello BPDUs (2 seconds)
			Hello BPDU only forwarded through designated ports, not root ports
		Forward delay - How long the switch will stay in the listening & learning states (15 seconds)
		Max Age - How long an interface will wait after ceasing to receive Hello BPDUs to change the STP topology (10 * Hello Timer)
		Timers throughout network are determined by route bridge

STP BPDU
	Regular STP uses dest MAC of 0180.c200.0000
	Cisco's PVST+ (PVST = ISL, PVST+ = 802.1Q) uses dest MAC of 01:00:0c:cc:cc:cd
	Message Age = 0 + number of jumps

Optional Features
	Portfast: enables a port to go straight to the forwarding state, bypassing listening and learning
		Must be enabled only on ports connected to end hosts
			Could create a layer 2 loop if used on a port connected to another switch
		Enabled with spanning-tree portfast
			Enable on all access ports from global config via spanning-tree portfast default
	BPDU Guard: when a BPDU is received from another switch, the interface temporarily shuts down to prevent a loop from forming
		Enable with spanning-tree bpduguard enable
			Enable on all portfast-enabled interfaces with spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
	Root Guard: even if the interface receives a superior BPDU, the switch won't accept the new switch as the root bridge and will disable the interface
	Loop Guard: even if the interface stops receiving BPDUs, it won't stop forwarding

Configuration
	Configuring the Primary Root Bridge (for each VLAN)
		spanning-tree vlan x root primary - sets the STP priority to 24576 or 4096 less than the current lowest priority on a switch
		STP Load-balancing is the process of configuring a different root bridge for each VLAN
	Configuring Port Priority & Cost
		spanning-tree vlan x cost
		spanning-tree vlan x port-priority

STP Port ID
	The format us 0x_ _ _ _
	The first two characters are the port priority
