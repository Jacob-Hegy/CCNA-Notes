# [[1. Repeaters, Hubs, Switches, and Routers#Hub (Layer 1)|Hub]]
- Layer 1 device
- CAT5 unshielded twisted pair cable with RJ45 connector for connecting PC to hub
- Very similar to how wireless networks work
- Nonintelligent & does not understand the frames being sent through it
- Essentially a multiport repeater
	- Receives data and sends it out of all other ports
	- Physical topology: Star (central device \[the hub] with devices hanging off the hub as spokes \[the PCs]; all traffic flows through the central point when communicating between endpoints)
	- Good for availability even in the face of a cable break
	- Can extend to further distances easily by incorporating signal repeaters
- Receives traffic, then amplifies the traffic and sends it to all ports except for the one it received it on (relies on the NICs of the PCs to recognize when a frame is destined for them based on MAC addresses)
- Logical topology: Bus (single collision domain) because all broadcasts are received by everyone (single broadcast domain)
# All Interfaces
- Default speed setting = auto
- Default duplex setting = auto
- Set the speed of an interface with `(config-if)# speed <int mbps>`
- Set the duplex of an interface with `(config-if)# duplex [full | half]`
- CSMA/CD is used to avoid collisions on half-duplex interfaces (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Detection)
- The `runts` error counter counts the frames that reach a switch/router that are smaller than the minimum frame size of 64 bytes
- The `giants` error counter counts the frames that reach a switch/router that are greater than the maximum frame size of 1518 bytes
- The `CRC` error counter counts the frames that reach a switch/router that failed their error check in the Ethernet FCS trailer
- The `frame` error counter counts the frames that reach a switch/router that have an incorrect/illegal format
- The `input errors` counter counts the total amount of errors received by the device
- The `output errors` counter counts the total amount of frames the switch failed to send
# Routers
- In `administratively down/down` by default when not connected to anything
# Switches
- In `down/down` by default when not connected to anything
- In `up/up` by default when not connected to anything
