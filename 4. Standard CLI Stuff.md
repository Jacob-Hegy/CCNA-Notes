- When connecting to the console port of a Cisco device, use a rollover cable
- Cisco Console Port Default Settings:
	- Parity = None
		- Parity adds an extra bit to binary code to ensure the accuracy of transmitted data
	- Speed = 9600 bits per second
	- Data bits = 8
	- Stop bits = 1
	- Flow control = None

- DO NOT CONNECT A ROLLOVER CABLE FROM THE ETHERNET PORT ON YOUR PC TO THE CONSOLE PORT OF YOUR CISCO ROUTER/SWITCH - IT WILL BLOW THE PORT
	- Old Solution: you'd use a male RJ45 to female DB9 (serial) cable, connecting the DB9 to the PC and the RJ45 to the router
	- New Solution:
		1. Use a USB to male DB9 cable, then connect that to the female DB9 to male RJ45 cable
		2. Use a USB-A to USB-A cable between the PC and router/switch
- Running-config = the current, active configuration file on the device; this is the config that's edited by commands
- Startup-config = the configuration file that will be loaded upon restart of the device
## Common CLI Commands
- Configure a password with `(config)# enable password <password>`
- Configure an encrypted password with `(config)# enable secret <password>`
	- If both password and secret are both configured, the password will be ignored
- View the running-config with `R# show running-config`
- View the startup-config with `R# show startup-config`
- Save the current running-config to startup-config with `R# wr`
- Encrypt all passwords in running-config with `(config)# service password-encryption`
	- Uses **type 7** encryption
- View a description of each interface on a router with `R# show interfaces description`
