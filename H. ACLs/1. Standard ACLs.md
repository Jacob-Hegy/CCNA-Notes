## Types:
### Standard ACLs - match based on source IP address ONLY
- Standard Numbered ACLs
- Standard Named ACLs
### Extended ACLs - match based on source/destination IP, source/destination port, etc.
- Extended Numbered ACLs
- Extended Named ACLs
**Each interface on a router can only have one ACL applied in each direction (inbound and outbound). Applying a new one replaces the old one**
### Standard Numbered ACLs
- Only cares about source IP
- Numbered ACLs are ID'd with a number (ex. ACL 1, ACL 2, etc.)
	Can use numbers in the ranges 1-99 and 1300-1999
- Configure with `(config)# access-list <number> {deny | permit} <ip> <wildcard-mask>`
	- Due to implicit deny, we must also configure `(config)# access-list <number> permit any`
- You can add a comment to the ACL to remember its purpose with the following: `(config)# access-list <number> remark <REMARK>`
**View all access lists on the router with** `(config)# do show access-lists`
**View ACL configs with** `(config)# do show running-config | include access-list`
**Apply an ACL to an interface with** `(config-if)# ip access-group <number> {in | out}`
### Standard Named ACLs
- Function the same as numbered ACLs but are ID'd with a name
- Configured by entering "standard ACL config mode"
	Enter standard ACL config mode with `(config)# ip access-list standard <acl-name>`
	Make rules with `(config-std-nacl)# [entry-number] {deny | permit} <ip> <wildcard-mask>`
