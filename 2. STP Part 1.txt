Redundancy in networks
	Helps to meet constant uptime
	If a component fails, other components should pick up the slack with little or no downtime
	Implement at every possible point in the network
	Bad design: single router, single connections to switches, etc.
	Good design: multiple routers, multiple ways to reach a switch
	Servers often have multiple NICs, so plugging into multiple switches can provide redundancy
		PCs usually don't have the capability to plug into multiple switches
	STP enables redundant layer 2 networks

Broadcast Storms
	Occurs when a switch doesn't know where a broadcast came from, resulting in a continuous, infinite broadcast
		Layer 2 lacks a TTL
		Congests network and forces switches to continuously update their MAC address table (MAC flapping)

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
	Classic Spanning Tree Protocol
	On all switches by default
	Places redundant ports in a blocking state (basically disables the interface)
		Will enter a forwarding state if an active, currently forwarding interfaces fails
	Interfaces in a forwarding state behave normally, sending and receiving all normal traffic
	Blocking interfaces only send and receive BPDU and STP traffic
	***When spanning tree refers to bridge, it means switch***
	Prevents broadcast storms
	By using blocking ports, a single path to and from each point in the network is created to prevent loops
	Process of selecting blocking and open ports
		1. All switches send out Hello BPDU packets
			Any switch that receives a Hello BPDU knows that it is connected to another switch
			Any port that does not receive a Hello BPDU stays open
		2. A root bridge is determined
			The root bridge is the one with the lowest bridge ID
				Bridge ID: 
					Bridge Priority (16 bits) | MAC Address (48 bits)
						Bridge Priority: Bridge Priority (4 bits) | Extended System ID (VLAN ID) (12 bits)
						Given that Bridge Priority is 16 bits and the most significant bit of Bridge Priority is default 1, the bridge priority is actually 32768 + VLAN ID
						Bridge Priority can only be incremented in amount of 4096
			By default, all bridges have a default bridge priority of 32768
				In the event of a tie, the lowest MAC address is designated the root bridge
		3. Set all ports on the root bridge in a forwarding state
			All other switches must have a route to the root bridge
	When a switch is powered on, it assumes it's the root bridge until met with a BPDU with a lower bridge ID (a "superior" BPDU)
		Once the root bridge has been decided on, only the root bridge sends BPDU; other bridges forward BPDUs from the root bridge
	Process after designating root bridge
		1. All other switches will select one interface to be its root port; this port will be in a forwarding state
			Root port is determined based on the port with the lowest root cost
			Root cost
				Port Speed | Cost
				10 Mbps    =  100 (Ethernet)
				100 Mbps   =   19 (Fast Ethernet [Fa])
				1 Gbps     =    4 (Gigabit) [G] 
				10 Gbps    =    2 (10 Gigabit)
				Root cost = total cost of outgoing interfaces on the path to the root bridge
					The root cost of all ports on the root bridge is 0
				All bridges send out BPDU packets advertising their root cost
				Bridges receive these BPDUs and send them out of their outgoing interfaces while incrementing them by the cost of the interface
				From there, they choose their root port
				The root port is the bridge's path to the root bridge
				In the event of a tie, the root port is the one connecting to the port with the lowest neighbor bridge ID
				If both root cost and neighbor bridge ID tie, then lowest neighbor port ID is used as the final tiebreaker
					STP Port ID = port priority (default 128) + port number
						G0/0 lower than G0/1 lower than G1/0 etc.
	After designating all root ports and designated ports
		Remaining connections must select which interface will be the designated port
			Lowest root cost port will become designated
			If same root cost, use lowest bridge ID
			The non-designated port will be non-designated (blocking)

Checking STP in CLI
	show spanning-tree [vlan x]: to show port costs and roles (root/designated/non-designated)
	show spanning-tree detail: same as "show spanning-tree" but with more information
		This command features the total cost for a port
	show spanning-tree summary: shows the amount of ports of each time running in each VLAN
