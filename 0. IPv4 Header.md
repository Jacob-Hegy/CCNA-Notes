### Version:
- 4 bits
- Identifies the version of IP
	- Either IPv4 (0100) or IPv6 (0110)
### IHL (Internet Header Length):
- 4 bits
- Because the options field of the header is variable in length, this field is used to indicate the header's total length
- Length is indicated it in increments of 4 bytes
	- Ex. if IHL = 1001 then the length is equal to 9 * 4 = 36 bytes
- Minimum IPv4 Header Length = 20 bytes
- Maximum IPv4 Header Length = 60 bytes
### DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point):
- 6 bits
- Used to prioritize delay-sensitive data with [[27. QoS|QoS]]
### ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification):
- 2 bits
- Provides end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping packets
- Optional; must be supported by both endpoints and the network infrastructure
### Total Length:
- 16 bits
- Indicates the total length of the packet (L3 header + L4 segment)
- Measured in increments of single bytes
- Minimum value = 20
- Maximum value = 65535
### Identification:
- 16 bits
- If a packet is fragmented due to being too large, this field IDs which packet the fragment belongs to
	- All fragments of the same packet will have their own IPv4 header with the same value in this field
- Packets are fragmented if larger than the MTU
### Flags:
- 3 bits
- Used to control/identify fragments
- Bit 0: Reserved; always set to 0
- Bit 1: DF bit ("Don't Fragment"); used to indicate a packet that shouldn't be fragmented
- Bit 2: MF bit ("More Fragments"); set to 1 if there are more fragments in the packet, set to 0 for the last fragment
	- Unfragmented packets set the MF bit to 0
### Fragment Offset:
- 13 bits
- Used to indicate the position of the fragment in the original, unfragmented packet
### TTL:
- 8 bits
- Packets with TTL of 0 are dropped
- Used to stop infinite loops
### Protocol:
- 8 bits
- Indicates the protocol of the encapsulated L4PDU
- 6 = TCP, 17 = UDP, 1 = ICMP, 89 = OSPF
### Header Checksum:
- 16 bits
- Calculated checksum used to check for errors
- Only used to check for errors in the IPv4 header, not the encapsulated data
### Source/Destination IP Address:
- 32 bits each
- Take a guess
### Options:
- 0 - 320 bits
- If [[#IHL (Internet Header Length)|IHL]] > 5, options are present
