- Enabled on Cisco devices by default
- Periodically sent to multicast MAC address `0100.0CCC.CCCC`
	- Not forwarded to other devices (thus only neighbors receive CDP messages)
- By default, sent every 60 seconds
- Holdtime of 180 seconds; if a message isn't received in that time, the neighboring device is removed from the CDP neighbor table
## Useful Commands
`# show cdp` - supplies CDP config info
`# show cdp traffic` - supplies info on packets sent and received
`# show cdp interface` - supplies basic information on each interface of the selected device
`# show cdp neighbors` - lists the CDP neighbor table
	`# show cdp neighbors detail` - provides a more detailed listing of CDP neighbors
`# show cdp entry <name>` - provides the same information that `neighbors detail` does, but only for the specified device
## Configuring CDP
`(config)# [no] cdp run` - either enable or disable CDP on a device
`(config-if)# [no] cdp enable` - either enable or disable CDP on a specific interface
`(config)# cdp timer <seconds>` - configure how often CDP messages are sent out
`(config)# cdp holdtime <seconds>` - configure how long a device will wait on CDP messages before removing a neighbor from its CDP neighbors table
`(config)# [no] cdp advertise-v2` - enable or disable CDPv2
