## Native VLAN
Setting native VLAN to an unused VLAN is best practice
Frames are untagged (allows for faster traffic flow due to smaller packets)
## Layer 3 Switch (Multilayer Switch)
- Capable of both switching and routing
	- Sees both MAC addresses and IP addresses
- You can assign IP address to its interfaces
- Capable of making virtual interfaces for each VLAN & assign them IP addresses
- You can configure routes on it like a router
- Capable of inter-VLAN routing
### Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs)
- Virtual interfaces you can assign IP addresses to in a multilayer switch
- Configure each PC to use the SVI as their gateway, not the router
- The PCs will send traffic to the switch and the switch will route it to the appropriate VLAN
- Set a default route to the router so that any traffic destined for outside the network will go to the router
# Configuration
- Configure the native VLAN on a sub-interface with `(config-subif)# encapsulation dot1q <VLAN ID> native`
- Create an SVI for a VLAN with `(config)# interface vlan <VLAN ID>`
- Enable Layer 3 routing on a Multilayer Switch with `(config)# ip routing`
- Configure an interface as a routed port (enables Layer 3/IP addressing) with `(config-if)# no switchport`
- Configure the default route with `(config-if)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <IP Address>`
