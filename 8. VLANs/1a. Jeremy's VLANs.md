# Overview
- Used to logically separate hosts on Layer 2
- Configured on switch interfaces
- Switches won't forward traffic directly between hosts in different VLANs
	- You don't need to configure IP addresses for the interfaces on layer 2 switches (duh)
- VLANs 1, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005 exist by default
# Configuration
- Create a VLAN with `(config)# vlan <VLAN id>`
- Set an interface as an access port with `(config-if)# switchport mode access`
	- Set the VLAN accessible via the access port with `(config-if)# switchport access vlan <VLAN id>`
- View existing VLANs with `S# show vlan brief`
- Name a VLAN with `(config-vlan)# name <name>`
