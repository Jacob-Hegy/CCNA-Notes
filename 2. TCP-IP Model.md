![[OSI vs TCP-IP.png]]

- 5 Layer TCP/IP Model is generally regarded as more relevant than the 7 Layer OSI Model
- Layer 4 PDU (protocol date unit) = segments; Layer 4 uses ports
- Layer 3 PDU = packets; Layer 3 uses IP addresses
- Layer 2 PDU = frames; Layer 2 uses MAC addresses
- Layer 1 uses bits

# OSI Model
## Layer 7 - Application
- Layer closest to the end user
- Interacts with software apps, like web browsers
- HTTP\[S] is a Layer 7 protocol
	- Identifying communication partners
	- Synchronizing communication
## Layer 6 - Presentation
- Data is in "application format"
	- Needs to be translated to a different format to be sent over the network
- The **Presentation Layer's job** is to translate between application and network formats
	- Ex. Encryption/Decryption occurs on Layer 6
## Layer 5 - Session
- Controls dialogue/sessions between communicating hosts
- Establishes, manages, and terminates connections between the local application and the remote application
	- Ex. The connection between the web browser and foreign site
## Layer 4 - Transport
- Segments and reassembles data for communication between end hosts
- Breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments which can be more easily sent over the network and are less likely to cause transmission problems if errors occur
- Provides host-to-host communication
- Layer 4 Header
- TCP/UDP
## Layer 3 - Network
- Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks (outside of the LAN)
- IP addressing
- Routers operate on Layer 3
- Layer 3 Header
## Layer 2 - Data Link
- Provides note-to-node connectivity and data transfer (ex. PC to switch, switch to router, etc.)
- MAC addresses
- Defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium (ex. copper UTP cables)
- **Detects and possibly corrects Physical Layer errors**
- Switches operate at Layer 2
- Layer 2 Header & Trailer
## Layer 1 - Physical
- Defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices
	- Ex. Voltage levels, maximum transmission distances, physical connectors, cable specifications
- Digital bits are converted into electrical (for wired connections) or radio (for wireless connections) signals
- Cables, pin layouts, etc.

## PDUs
- Layer 5-7 = Data
- Layer 4 = Segment
- Layer 3 = Packet
- Layer 2 = Frame
- Layer 1 = Bit
# TCP/IP Suite
- Session/Presentation/Application (Layers 5-7) = Application (Layer 4)
- Transport (Layer 4) = Transport (Layer 3)
- Network (Layer 3) = Internet (Layer 2)
- Physical/Data Link (Layers 1-2) = Link (Layer 1)
